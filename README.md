# Dummy-App
Dummy app is a single page that is part of an application for sports enthusiasts to register their names to lists of their favourite sporting activities and what days they are available to participate.

Gulp was used in development to monitor the development files in `/app`. Styling was modified in `./app/stylesheets/styles.scss` with Gulp converting Sass styles to CSS, with auto-prefixer included to add CSS vendor prefixes to allow support for older browsers. Gulp Babel also transpiles `./app/scripts/app.js` to ES5 JavaScript in `./scripts/app.js`. Both `index.html` files will load the page, but the root `index.html` is better supported for older browsers as it is ES5 compliant. 

Any future development work will require the installation of Gulp. Clone this repository, and in the root of the project run `npm install` to install all dependencies. After installation, updates can be made to the development files `./app/index.html`. `./app/stylesheets/styles.scss` and `./app/scripts/app.js`. Any changes made to these files will be updated to the development server provided by Gulp at `localhost:3000`
